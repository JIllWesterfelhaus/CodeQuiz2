# CodeQuiz2
This is the second version of the JS Code Quiz.

## Description
This app presents multiple choice questions on coding.  The user has 120 seconds to finish the quiz.  At the end, the user is presented with the number of correct answers, incorrect answers and unanswered questions.

## Motivation
This is an assignment from Northwestern University's Coding Bootcamp.

## Contributors
This was built by Jill Westerfelhaus, with assistance from her tutor, Daniel Masters.

## Tech Used
This was built with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Build Status
The basic functions of the quiz (the timer, presenting the questions and the final score) are complete.  

## Future Development
Two aspects of the assignment have not been developed so far.  These are decrementing 10 seconds from the timer and saving the user's score and initials.  These are possible items for future development.

## Credits
I wish to thank my tutor, Daniel Masters. I could not have done this without his patient assistance and support.
